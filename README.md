LearnBridge – Smart eLearning Platform

LearnBridge is a modern, full-stack eLearning platform designed to connect students, teachers, and administrators through a seamless digital learning experience. The system provides structured course delivery, live classes, interactive Q&A, AI-powered doubt assistance, secure payments, and role-based dashboards—all within one unified platform.

Students can browse courses, purchase them securely, access lessons, join live sessions, and interact through Q&A and chat. A built-in AI assistant helps students get instant explanations and clear doubts. Teachers have a dedicated dashboard where they can create courses, upload lessons, schedule live classes, manage enrolled students, and track their earnings through a wallet system. The admin panel provides complete control over platform operations, including user management, teacher verification, course moderation, promotions (coupons and offers), payment tracking, and platform-wide analytics.

LearnBridge is built with a React frontend for fast, responsive UI and a Django REST API backend for scalable business logic. MySQL is used for structured data storage, and WebSockets support real-time communication. The platform integrates secure payment gateways and includes a flexible authentication system with role-based access control.

LearnBridge aims to deliver a professional, feature-rich, and scalable solution for modern online education.
